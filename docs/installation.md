## Installation

This application does not require installation.<br>
If you are using a [binary version](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX-SPMT/releases), just unzip the folder anywhere you like and use the executable to start the application:

- *Linux*: double-click `SecurePivxMasternodeTool` file inside the `app` directory
- *Windows*: double-click `SecurePivxMasternodeTool.exe` file inside the `app` directory
- *Mac OsX*: double-click `SecurePivxMasternodeTool.app` application folder

If you are running SPMT from the source-code instead, you will need Python3 and several libraries installed.<br>
Needed libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.<br>
From the `SPMT` directory, launch the tool with:

```bash
python3 spmt.py
```
<br>To make binary versions from source, [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) can be used with the `SecurePivxMasternode.spec` file provided.
